# Node-RED Contrib Downloader

This customized Node-RED is used for downloading files. If you want to download file without setting in this node, you can input in msg.payload as JSON format like 

```
{"url":"URL","path":"Save Absolute Path"}
```

Then, after deploying this flow, you have to inject the input from another node to invoke download node.
